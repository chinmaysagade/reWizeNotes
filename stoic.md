### CONTROL AND CHOICE. 
“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to
myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I
actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but
within myself to the choices that are my own . . .”   

### EDUCATION IS FREEDOM   
Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is
not to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose.   

### BE RUTHLESS TO THE THINGS THAT DON’T MATTER.    
be aware of what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief, foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements—how
little of your own was left to you. You will realize you are dying before your time!   

### THE BIG THREE.  
- Control your perceptions
- Direct your actions
- Willingly accept what’s outside your control.   

### CLARIFY YOUR INTENTIONS.  
Plan all the way to the end. That way, you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop.   
To the Stoics, oiêsis (false conceptions) are responsible not just for disturbances in the soul but for chaotic and dysfunctional lives and operations.

### SEVEN CLEAR FUNCTIONS OFTHE MIND.  
- Choice—to do and think right. 
- Refusal—of temptation  
- Yearning—to be better. 
- Repulsion—of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn’t true
- Preparation—for what lies ahead or whatever may happen
- Purpose—our guiding principle and highest priority
- Assent—to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside our control (and be ready to accept
the latter).  

### PEACE IS IN STAYING THE COURSE.   
“believing in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad
footpaths of those wandering in every direction.” It is this state of mind, he says, that produces tranquility.    

### THE TRUTH ABOUT MONEY.  
money only marginally changes life. It doesn’t solve the problems that people without it seem to think it will.   
In fact, no material possession will. External things can’t fix internal issues.
