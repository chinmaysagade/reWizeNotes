### Mechanics of Life : Quality:
The quality of life  is dependent on how we experience life. Joy or blissfulness is not dependent on what car you are driving or where you are living. 

### Mechanics of Life: Unconsious living 
What is the use of a self-driving car which does not want to go where you want to go ?

### Mechanics of Life: Search for pleasantness
When you say you want to go to heaven, you are in search of pleasantness. If someone told you that heaven is a horrendous place but God lives there, you would pray from here only.

### Mechanics of Life: Search for peace
Being peaceful is not the ultimate goal in life. Whatever you are deprived of becomes  the highest goal in life. Since peace is missing, it has become the goal. How many times have you realized that reaching another milestone does not give you any peace.

### Mechanics of Life: Compulsive habits
Body is a series of compulsions. Because it looks like compulsion, it looks like it's fine.

### Mechanics of Life: Boundaries
Nature of human existence: to need more. There is something within you which does not like boundaries. No matter how big the boundary, the moment you can feel it, you don't like it. Stuck in Dharavi is the same as being stuck in Dadar.

### Mechanics of Life: Will
100% should not happen the way you want it. Just the 1% under your control should happen your way.

### Bondage : Desires
Desire is driving all the small/big decisions in your life. What you desire is a social phenomenon (influenced by the social atmosphere). The content of the desire is not important since it's in reaction to society. 

### Bondage : Desires
The energy that you call desire is no different that the energy you call life.If you get rid of all of your desires, there will be no drive to do anything.Desires arose naturally in the body. no desire = no life.    
Not desiring anything is a great desire, which will always remain unfulfilled.

### Bondage : Misery
Basis of all misery is unfulfilled desire. Life is not happening the way you think it should happen. And the way you think it should happen changes everyday.

### Bondage : Desires
People coming out of restaurants seem happier than those coming out of temples.    
Don't look at the object of desire, but the process of desire. The process of desire drives you to a boundless state. It's not for more, but for all. If it had a limit, it could have been settled. 


### Bondage : Suffering
Fear of suffering keeps you away from achieving great things. 

### Bondage : Detatchment
 That you are not involved in, you cannot touch it. If you want to detach from life, jumping into the ocean is the most effective method. Krishna showed absolute involvement in his life, not detachment. It's not easy to detach from something you care about.
Detaching is avoiding life. The only way to live life is to be involved deeply.

### Bondage : Boundless
There is something within you which tries to be boundless all the time.    

### Bondage : Compulsive Reaction
The Compulsive state of action can only bring misery.Thought and emotion are physiological reality, not an existential reality.  
Words do not harm you, your reaction to them makes you suffer.     
You want your mind to be liberated from misery, rather than controlled.   
Desire happening compulsively is a problem, if it happens consciously, it's the most wonderful thing.   

### Living : Anger
When you get angry  you suffer more than your victim. Anger, hatred, jealousy is literal poison. And if you drink poison, you die.

### Living : Liveness
walk around like a stone between people you don't know. Putting restrictions on ability to respond kills live-ness.

### Living : Responsibility. 
Being able to act requires a lot of different things. But being responsible only requires willingness. The moment you feel you are not responsible, you loose the sense of belongingness. Actions are limited, but responsibility is not limited.     
If you are not responding, you are effectively a stone.


### Living : Ability. 
In life, if you don't do what you cannot do, it's fine. But if you do not do what you can do, then your life is a disaster.

### Living : Mind.   
Life is happening because it's responding to the universe. Only in your mind do you have walls of resistance If you remove the barriers, the mind will work for you, else it will work against you.

### Living : Karma.   
Wherever you pass the back, it will make its round and come back to you. You think you are throwing it somewhere, like getting angry at someone. But it will come back to you. There is a natural consequence within you of every action.    

Stop passing the buck.    
If i am happy it's me, if not it's me.   
If i make it it's me, if not it's me.   
If I am at the peak it's me, if in the dumps it's me.    
If I lose it's me, if I win it's me.    

### Living : Mind.  
Your body needs preservation, once destroyed cannot be rebuilt. But thoughts, beliefs can be destroyed and can be recreated within minutes.You respond to everything you are in touch with at any moment. If you are not selective with your response, you will be involved with everything around you. If you refuse to get involved, you have nothing to take away, you are not even alive.   

### Living : Suffering.    
Suffering is directly proportional to distance from  truths about your existence. How far away from truth you are, that's how deep your suffering is. If good people are suffering, then who is farther from the truth ? the idea that i am good , how is it coming?    

### Life: This moment is inevitable:   
There is always only the present, no past, no future.   
Truth is not something you get, you need to yield to it.     
If you accept what is there right now, that is the end of human suffering.    
This inevitability is not a bondage, it's the only freedom you have.    
If you think about the past or future, it's not a problem. Trying to enter it is the problem.        

### Life: This moment is inevitable:
Being aware of the inevitability of this moment is just about realizing that all that is there right now is all there is; it cannot be any other way. Not to mistake psychological fluctuations for reality. In this, there is tremendous relief from the unnecessary resistance to that which you cannot change. But above all, there is the empowerment of creating your life the way you want it: by accepting this moment, creating the next moment is in your hands.From this moment onwards, observe the impact of this awareness on the way you are and everything that you do.   

#### Mind - The Miracle. 
Anything you accept becomes a part of you. whatever you resist, sticks out in front of you like an obstacle.    
As you are a part of existence, existence is a part of you. As a drop is a part of the ocean, the ocean is a part of the drop. As you are a part of the cosmos, the cosmos is a part of you.  

#### Mind - The Miracle.    
Time and space are the creation of your logical mind. If you transcend the limitation of your logical mind, you transcend the limitation of time and space. If you are in absolute acceptance, then everything is here and now.

#### Mind - Compulsion.   
You doing what you like to do is not freedom. It's slavery to your compulsions.

#### Mind - Karma. 
Mind is deeply conditioned by past activity. This conditioning of mind is called karma. All the things that you do , knowingly or unknowingly, the residual impact rules the way you think , feel and experience your life. That is your karma. 

### Mind: Karma
Same sound (heavy metal) can be perceived as ecstatic or horrible. Seeing things as beautiful, ugly or sweet , all depends on your past imprint and is referred to as Karma. The very way you experience everything is your own making. Right now , you are making it up in a compulsive way. Today the sun came up in a glorious way, but if someone is depressed, we say it's own making (his own karma).

### Mind: Karma.  
If you are in a process of liking and disliking, karma builds up at a rapid pace. If you are in acceptance, karma begins to crumble within you


#### Mind: Life.  
My life is 100% my doing. If you see this, you will create the life you want. Otherwise you will spend the rest of your life disliking one, complaining about something else.Feeling helpless and cornered. If you can think this much, you can use this power to think something else and create a different life.

### Create what you want.  
It's only by involvement you know life.   

### Create what you want.   
If you don't agree with the rules of the game, you are not involved. if you are not involved, you cannot experience it.

#### Create what you want.   
pay attention to creation and you cannot get bored. you only get bored when you are stuck in your own mnd.
