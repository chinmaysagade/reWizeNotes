### Mechanics of Life : Quality:
The quality of life  is dependent on how we experience life. Joy or blissfulness is not dependent on what car you are driving or where you are living. 

### Mechanics of Life: Unconsious living 
What is the use of a self-driving car which does not want to go where you want to go ?

### Mechanics of Life: Search for pleasantness
When you say you want to go to heaven, you are in search of pleasantness. If someone told you that heaven is a horrendous place but God lives there, you would pray from here only.

### Mechanics of Life: Search for peace
Being peaceful is not the ultimate goal in life. Whatever you are deprived of becomes  the highest goal in life. Since peace is missing, it has become the goal. How many times have you realized that reaching another milestone does not give you any peace.

### Mechanics of Life: Compulsive habits
Body is a series of compulsions. Because it looks like compulsion, it looks like it's fine.

### Mechanics of Life: Boundaries
Nature of human existence: to need more. There is something within you which does not like boundaries. No matter how big the boundary, the moment you can feel it, you don't like it. Stuck in Dharavi is the same as being stuck in Dadar.

### Mechanics of Life: Will
100% should not happen the way you want it. Just the 1% under your control should happen your way.

### Bondage : Desires
Desire is driving all the small/big decisions in your life. What you desire is a social phenomenon (influenced by the social atmosphere). The content of the desire is not important since it's in reaction to society. 

### Bondage : Desires
The energy that you call desire is no different that the energy you call life.If you get rid of all of your desires, there will be no drive to do anything.Desires arose naturally in the body. no desire = no life.    
Not desiring anything is a great desire, which will always remain unfulfilled.

### Bondage : Misery
Basis of all misery is unfulfilled desire. Life is not happening the way you think it should happen. And the way you think it should happen changes everyday.

### Bondage : Desires
People coming out of restaurants seem happier than those coming out of temples.    
Don't look at the object of desire, but the process of desire. The process of desire drives you to a boundless state. It's not for more, but for all. If it had a limit, it could have been settled. 


### Bondage : Suffering
Fear of suffering keeps you away from achieving great things. 

### Bondage : Detatchment
 That you are not involved in, you cannot touch it. If you want to detach from life, jumping into the ocean is the most effective method. Krishna showed absolute involvement in his life, not detachment. It's not easy to detach from something you care about.
Detaching is avoiding life. The only way to live life is to be involved deeply.

### Bondage : Boundless
There is something within you which tries to be boundless all the time.    

### Bondage : Compulsive Reaction
The Compulsive state of action can only bring misery.Thought and emotion are physiological reality, not an existential reality.  
Words do not harm you, your reaction to them makes you suffer.     
You want your mind to be liberated from misery, rather than controlled.   
Desire happening compulsively is a problem, if it happens consciously, it's the most wonderful thing.   

### Living : Anger
When you get angry  you suffer more than your victim. Anger, hatred, jealousy is literal poison. And if you drink poison, you die.

### Living : Liveness
walk around like a stone between people you don't know. Putting restrictions on ability to respond kills live-ness.

### Living : Responsibility. 
Being able to act requires a lot of different things. But being responsible only requires willingness. The moment you feel you are not responsible, you loose the sense of belongingness. Actions are limited, but responsibility is not limited.
