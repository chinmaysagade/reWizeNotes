### Generalization vs Optimization.  

The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization. "Optimization" refers to the process of adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data (the "learning" in "machine learning"), while "generalization" refers to how well the trained model would perform on data it has never seen before. The goal of the game is to get good generalization, of course, but you do not control generalization; you can only adjust the model based on its training data.

At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower your loss on training data, the lower your loss on test data. While this is happening, your model is said to be under-fit: there is still progress to be made; the network hasn't yet modeled all relevant patterns in the training data. But after a certain number of iterations on the training data, generalization stops improving, validation metrics stall then start degrading: the model is then starting to over-fit, i.e. is it starting to learn patterns that are specific to the training data but that are misleading or irrelevant when it comes to new data.
