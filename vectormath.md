### What is a vector
A vector is something which is a member of vector space. 
A vector can be any object (directed line, 2x2 matrix, a brick, a person etc. ).
Vector algebra is like saying a "card game" , and uno and blackjack, texas holdem can be vector space if they follow rules such that 1)a player having the best hand is guranteed to win regardless of his turn, every draw has a result, etc. 

### Elementary Vector Spaces:
A vector space S is defined by a set of vectors, binary operator + (vector addition property) such that it is closed under the operation and linear transformation properties:
1) Scalar multiplication gets another vector in the space
2) Scaling and adding is same as adding and scaling

A vector space over real numbers is called Real vector space. It can also be over complex numbers, quaternions or octonions. 
Other properties
Two vector spaces in R can potentially be distinguished by their bases 
A vector space with n bases is called n-dimensional
Two vector spaces are isomorphic , if elements in one has 1-1 correspondence with another
Does not have concepts of dot product, cross product or even magnitude. Those are additional properties that a vector space can have but are not required for elementary vector spaces. 

### Dual Space: V*
Set of all possible maps that map a vector space V (its basis) into a real space.
It is desirable for the eigen maps inthe dual space to have a property that, when applied to the basis in vector space, it either maps it to 1 or to 0.  The choice of such maps is arbitrary and no such automatic mapping exists. 

/\1  e1 = 1   and /\2 e2 = 0 and /\3 e3= 0
/\1 e2 = 0   and /\2 e2 = 1 and /\3 e2= 0

In short, /\u Vv = 1 if u =v , else 0
