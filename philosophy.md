### What is Philosophy ?  
It is the academic study of anything. Love of wisdom.  
Seeing things through fresh eyes, asking new questions is doing philosophy.  
Philosophy comes out of existential questions:   
- Who am I    
- Why am I here   
- Where do I come from.   
  
William James writes:   
" Philosophy begining in wonder, as plato and aristotle said, is able to fancy everything different from what it is.  
It sees the familier as if it was strange, as strange as if it was familier.   
Philosophy rouses us from our native dogmatic slumber and wakes up from caked predejuices. "

### Three main branches of philosophy:   
- Metaphysics
- Epistemology
- Value Theory: Ethics and Aesthetics
- Logic

### Metaphysics: (Beyond Physics).    
Metaphysics is about things that do not change.
study of the nature of reality, of what exists in the world, what it is like, and how it is ordered.  
what is the nature of reality?  
What kind of being am I? Do I have a soul ? What happens when we die ?  
Is there a God?  
Do people have free will ?  

### Epistemology: 
Epistemology is the study of nature, origin and scope of knowledge. 
"what it is you believe is true ? ".    
What is knowledge ?  How to determine if someone knows something ?  
Determine the extent of what we know:  how do we acquire knowledge, and what are limits to what can be known ?     
Can we claim something to be right.    

### Epistemology: Knowledge. 
knowledge is a cognitive success.   
Objects: knowing by acquiantance.   
skills: procedural knowledge.(knowing -how).   
facts: propositional knowledge.  knowing-that.  2+2=1 , cats are mammals etc.    

### Epistemology: Knowledge.   
According to kant: knowledge can be a priori (derived only by reason) or a posteriori (sense experience in addition to reason).     

### Epistemology: Empiricists and Rationalists.   
**Empiricists**:  All knowledge is ultimately grounded upon experience.    
**Rationalists**: All knowledge is ultimately grounded upon reason.     

### Epistemology: Propositional Knowledge.   
Propositional knowledge has 3 core parts:   
**Belief**: An acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists. Sky is blue
**Truth**: The idea that one's beliefs are in accordance with reality or objective facts.   
**Justification**:   why one has good reason for holding their beliefs.   
**Justified True Beliefs (JTB) **  is full description of nature of knowledge.     
Getter believed that luck can play a part in acquire knowledge.

### Epistemology: Internalism vs Externalism.  
Reliabilism:   
Internalism: Justification depends on factors in one's mind.  

### Epistemology skepticism :    
the view that we cannot know anything, or atleast that we do not know as much as we think we do.   


### Epistemology: Catersian skepticism :    
we sometimes believe dream as if it's true. What if some devil is tricking us ?   


### Epistemology: PUN   
Nature is roughly uniform across time and space and thus the future will be roughly like the past (PUN).  
Principal Of Uniformity (PUN).   
PUN's proof is circular.    

### Epistemology: Mitigated Skepticism
We can never have 100% accurate knowledge of anything, but can have partial knowledge.  

### Epistemology Bayesian Epistemology:    
instead of having fixed beliefs, we keep updating probabilities.    
Credences: A continuous phenimenon of degress of beliefs about something.   
Priors: Credences we already have about reality before we begin to gather new evidence.   
Knowledge:  a combination of new information that updates our credences.    


### Value Theory: Ethics and Aesthetics. 
1) How should I live ?  
2) What is good or evil. 
3) What beauty is and whether it exists. 

### Logic:      
Logicians ask such questions as:  
What constitutes "good" or "bad" reasoning?  
How do we determine whether a given piece of reasoning is good or bad?  

### Forms of philosophy: 
Sayings ,enigmas and paradoxes: Kabir, Tao te ching
Dialogue: Gita
Geometric: axioms, postulates: Starts from definitions and deduct theorems
Ethics proven geometrically: Spinoza's ethics
Polemics:attacks

### Nihilism:
Means nothing or not at all. Nihilist says life has no meaning.
uncannas of the cosmos:we don't belong in the universe. The universe thwarts our efforts to understand it.

### Why are you here ?
Instrumental reasoning: Every point, the credits, the graduation, the job, the money are all instruments to the next moment. It's also called means-ends reasoning. So every single point is a means to the next end. I need to get my graduation in order to get the job. I get the three credits in order to graduate. Extrinsic Goods.


Human Finitude: We are all about to die and we are in the process of dying.  We don't know when the bus is coming. Life is a euphemism for the process of dying.


### Subjective and Objective :  Thomas Nagel.   
Meaning of life:    
If one tries to look at his life objectively, he’ll see that it is meaningless. Hence it is absurd that humans are trying to find some meaning in their lives, when at the same time, they are capable of viewing it from an external perspective and that it is meaningless.    
Still, it makes sense that I try to see meaning in my life because that’s how I usually live my life: From a personal, inner perspective. So it is indifferent that my life seems insignificant from an external point of view.   

Free Will:    
**Determinism** is a belief in philosophy that all events are determined by causes which have previously existed.    
The author states that the problem with determinism is that it leaves no room for the actual acting.     
From an external point of view, there’s only a chain of events. From a personal viewpoint, objectivity leaves out that it is my acting, no matter if it is deterministic or not. The person sees their actions as fundamentally different than other events that happen somehow.     


### Relativism:   
Family of philosophical views which deny claims to objectivity within a particular domain and assert that facts in that domain are relative to the perspective of an observer or the context in which they are assessed.     
Moral: Several philosophical positions concerned with the differences in moral judgments across different peoples and their own particular cultures.   
Nothing is good in itself, it's only right because person or society says it is.
Epistemic:Epistemic relativism is the view that what is true, rational, or justified for one person need not be true, rational, or justified for another person.  
Factual: Relativism argues that truth itself is relative.          
Protagoras on Relativism:   
Truth is what one guy makes it.  
Question:  Everyone is right, then what about someone who thinks everyone is wrong? 

### Socratic questioning:   
Socratic questioning is a form of disciplined questioning that can be used to pursue thought in many directions and for many purposes, including: to explore complex ideas, to get to the truth of things, to open up issues and problems, to uncover assumptions, to analyze concepts, to distinguish what we know from what we do not know, to follow out logical consequences of thought or to control discussions.      
The overall purpose of Socratic questioning, is to challenge accuracy and completeness of thinking in a way that acts to move people towards their ultimate goal.   
Conceptual clarification questions:  
Think more about what exactly they are asking or thinking about. Prove the concepts behind their argument. Use basic 'tell me more' questions that get them to go deeper.      
- Why are you saying that?   
- What exactly does this mean?   
- Can you give me an example?     

Probing assumptions:    
- What would happen if ... ?    
- You seem to be assuming ... ?     

Probing rationale, reasons and evidence:     
- Why is that happening?     
- What do you think causes ... ?   
- What evidence is there to support what you are saying?    

Probe implications and consequences:    
- Then what would happen?   
- What are the consequences of that assumption?   
- Why is ... important?
- What is the best ... ? Why?    

### Hellenistic period.   
The Hellenistic period spans the period of Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire.   
The period of Greece prior to the Hellenistic era is known as Classical Greece, while the period afterwards is known as Roman Greece.      
The term "Hellenistic" refers to that which is influenced by Greek culture, in this case, the East after the conquests of Alexander the Great.  
It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint, and the philosophies of Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Pyrrhonism. Greek science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes.
