### What is Philosophy ?  
It is the academic study of anything. Love of wisdom.  
Seeing things through fresh eyes, asking new questions is doing philosophy.  
Philosophy comes out of existential questions:   
- Who am I    
- Why am I here   
- Where do I come from.   
  
William James writes:   
" Philosophy begining in wonder, as plato and aristotle said, is able to fancy everything different from what it is.  
It sees the familier as if it was strange, as strange as if it was familier.   
Philosophy rouses us from our native dogmatic slumber and wakes up from caked predejuices. "   



### Three main branches of philosophy:   
- Metaphysics
- Epistemology
- Value Theory: Ethics and Aesthetics
- Logic

### Metaphysics: 
study of the nature of reality, of what exists in the world, what it is like, and how it is ordered.  
what is the nature of reality?  
What kind of being am I? Do I have a soul ? What happens when we die ?  
Is there a God?  
Do people have free will ?  

### Epistemology: 
Epistemology is the study of nature and scope knowledge. It is primarily concerned with what we can know about the world and how we can know it.   
Do we know anything at all?  
What is knowledge. 
Can we claim something to be right. 

### Value Theory: Ethics and Aesthetics. 
1) How should I live ?  
2) What is good or evil. 
3) What beauty is and whether it exists. 

### Logic:      
Logicians ask such questions as:  
What constitutes "good" or "bad" reasoning?  
How do we determine whether a given piece of reasoning is good or bad?  

### Forms of philosophy:

### Nihilism:
Means nothing or not at all. Nihilist says life has no meaning.
uncannas of the cosmos:we don't belong in the universe. The universe thwarts our efforts to understand it.

### Why are you here ?
Instrumental reasoning: Every point, the credits, the graduation, the job, the money are all instruments to the next moment. It's also called means-ends reasoning. So every single point is a means to the next end. I need to get my graduation in order to get the job. I get the three credits in order to graduate. Extrinsic Goods.


Human Finitude: We are all about to die and we are in the process of dying.  We don't know when the bus is coming. Life is a euphemism for the process of dying.
