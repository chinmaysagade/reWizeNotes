### Recall a Past Success 
- Why It Matters.   
University of Michigan neuroscientist Huda Akil describes active resilience as what happens when vulnerable people "find resources to cope with stress and bounce back," coming out even stronger at the other end.

- Pro Tip.   
If you did it then, you can do it again. Reliving the experience with someone else who was there at the time may help you fill in the details. Focus on how good you felt afterward.

### Cut Out the Comparisons
Feel the urge to compare yourself? Use a past version of you instead of someone else.
- Why It Matters.     
Research shows that comparing oneself to others leads to jealousy, depression, and lowered self-confidence — basically the opposite of happiness.  

- Pro Tip.   
Comparing your looks? Check out photos of yourself in middle school. Your artistic skills? Look at your work from a few years back. Relish how far you've come.
  
### Reflect on a Major Milestone. 
Consider a major event (or two) that positively changed the course of your life.
- Why It Matters.    
It’s human nature to become used to achievements, so much so that we may fail to feel grateful for them. Imagining how our lives might be different without those successes helps to re-surface appreciation for the good in our lives.
- Pro Tip.  
Try this reflection multiple times, each time “subtracting” a significant event or relationship. Feel that sudden, stark absence? That’s the place where gratitude takes root and flourishes.
  
### Rest and Reflect.   
Take 15 minutes at the end of your day to stop and reflect.
- Why It Matters.   
It's easy to get on autopilot, but pausing to reflect on how you spend your time keeps the days from blurring together and helps you think positively about your life.
- Pro Tip.  
You can do it alone, by journaling or making lists. Or talk with your loved ones about your daily experiences and moments of gratitude.

### See the Extraordinary in the Ordinary.   
Find new meaning in something familiar by seeing it in a different light.
- Why It Matters.  
As physician and best-selling author Rachel Naomi Remen says, “often finding meaning is not about doing things differently; it's about seeing familiar things in new ways.”

- Pro Tip.   
Hike down a familiar path and stay alert to new sights and sounds. Setup a phone date with an old friend, and be as curious as if you were meeting them again for the first time.  

### Be Grateful for the Small Stuff
Give thanks for little things that brighten up your life.

- Why It Matters.    
It's easy to get upset over petty annoyances (mosquitoes, car alarms, spilled milk), while ignoring the tiny sources of joy right under our noses (free cookies, sunshine peeking through rain and clouds, your morning coffee). 

- Pro Tip.    
Above all, slow down. Feel as if you're strolling down a quiet street, not jetting by at an altitude of 30,000 feet. When you encounter the smell of cinnamon, a four leaf clover, or whatever it is that gives you joy, stop and say, "thanks!" 

### Balance it your way.   
Weigh the elements of your life in a way that makes sense to you . . . not to somebody else.    

- Why It Matters.     
Another person’s idea of balance might not be right for you — in fact, it might cause more harm than good. Trust you know best what balance looks — and feels — like for you.    

- Pro Tip.    
Juggling life's many elements is an ongoing project, and we need all the help we can get. So seek advice from people who matter to you, read books, make spreadsheets. But then take time to reflect on what's right for you.    

###  Imagine Your Best Self, Then Be It.   
Today, choose to be the kind of person you aspire to be in one specific way. Pick one best self trait and one way to be closer to it.    

- Why It Matters.       
We are who we choose to be — so be very careful who you choose to be.    

- Pro Tip.    
Are you who you want to be? Imagine picking the person you want to be. Consider the characteristics of this person when they're at their best. How can you incorporate more of these characteristics in your life?
