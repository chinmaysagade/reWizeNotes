### Recall a Past Success 
- Why It Matters.   
University of Michigan neuroscientist Huda Akil describes active resilience as what happens when vulnerable people "find resources to cope with stress and bounce back," coming out even stronger at the other end.

- Pro Tip.   
If you did it then, you can do it again. Reliving the experience with someone else who was there at the time may help you fill in the details. Focus on how good you felt afterward.

### Cut Out the Comparisons
Feel the urge to compare yourself? Use a past version of you instead of someone else.
- Why It Matters.     
Research shows that comparing oneself to others leads to jealousy, depression, and lowered self-confidence — basically the opposite of happiness.  

- Pro Tip.   
Comparing your looks? Check out photos of yourself in middle school. Your artistic skills? Look at your work from a few years back. Relish how far you've come.
  
### Reflect on a Major Milestone. 
Consider a major event (or two) that positively changed the course of your life.
- Why It Matters.    
It’s human nature to become used to achievements, so much so that we may fail to feel grateful for them. Imagining how our lives might be different without those successes helps to re-surface appreciation for the good in our lives.
- Pro Tip.  
Try this reflection multiple times, each time “subtracting” a significant event or relationship. Feel that sudden, stark absence? That’s the place where gratitude takes root and flourishes.
  
### Rest and Reflect.   
Take 15 minutes at the end of your day to stop and reflect.
- Why It Matters.   
It's easy to get on autopilot, but pausing to reflect on how you spend your time keeps the days from blurring together and helps you think positively about your life.
- Pro Tip.  
You can do it alone, by journaling or making lists. Or talk with your loved ones about your daily experiences and moments of gratitude.
