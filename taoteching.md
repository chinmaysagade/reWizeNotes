### Chapter1: Universe and Me.   
Tao: The way.  Invisible law/  force/ energy.   
Te:  Manifestation of tao.   
Ching: Book or Scripture.     
We come from the universe and we go back to it. ET go home ! Humans wants to go home too.     

- "The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.  
The name that can be named is not the eternal name."   

Anything that can be visualized, or touched cannot be eternal truth.   The invisible force (like a magnatic force) cannot be heared, see or touch.  
The essence is formless, colorless, soundless, odorless.  
The act of applying intellect (naming it) narrows it down (constraints it).
